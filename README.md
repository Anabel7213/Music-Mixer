# Music-Mixer
Create and record your own music with this digital DJ Mixer!

## Objective 
My goal with this project was to learn how to use MediaDevices API to capture users' tracks and allow them to then save them locally.
All features have been tested and work properly except for a recorded track not playing what a user would hear when they are recording it, this is I figured due to our devices' microphones supressing the keyboard sounds and listening to the environment instead. So technically everything is working but you need an external microphone that will actually catch the sounds you play with DJ Mixer.

## Implementation 
DJ Mixer was first designed in Figma where I created variable components and defined their behavior on different screen sizes. When I started coding it, it was at times difficult to position everything properly, but it came out just perfectly as planned in the end which I'm really happy about. The layout is responsive and adjusts depending on the width of your device. 

This project is JavaScript heavy, so having been working on it was a good exercise. It features dynamic components and unique sounds for each button, a pause/resume and a reset functionality, a visual counter that stops counting when the track recording is paused, and many more.

## Instructions 
To play with your device's keyboard you want to use the following keys: w, a, s, d, z, x and b, n, m. Alternatively, you can mouse-click on any button. On a mobile device, you can simply tap.

Enjoy, and feel free to contribute to this project guys!
